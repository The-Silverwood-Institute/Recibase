    "Before you begin... Get all your ingredients and equipment ready. Skim through these steps. Wash your fruit and veg. Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins).",
    "Now, let's get started! Boil a kettle, then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat. Cut the courgette into quarters lengthways then slice finely. Once the pan is hot, add the sliced courgettes with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 1-2 min or until starting to soften.",
    "Chop the cherry tomatoes in half. Once the courgettes are starting to soften, add the roasted garlic paste, dried oregano and halved cherry tomatoes. Cook for a further 2-3 min or until fragrant.",
    "Meanwhile, add the gnocchi to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat. Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot. Once done, drain the gnocchi and reserve a cup of the starchy cooking water.",
    "Once the vegetables are fragrant, add the tomato frito and black olives with a generous pinch of black pepper and give everything a good mix up. Cook for 1-2 min or until the olives are warmed through.",
    "Chop the basil finely, including the stalks. Grate the cheddar.",
    "Stir in the drained gnocchi through the sauce and season to taste with a pinch of salt - this is your Mediterranean veg gnocchi. Tip: If the sauce is looking dry, add a splash of the reserved starchy gnocchi water.",
    "Serve the Mediterranean veg gnocchi and garnish with the chopped basil and grated cheddar. Enjoy!"
