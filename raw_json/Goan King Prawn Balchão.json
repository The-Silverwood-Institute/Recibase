    "Peel and dice the red onions (as finely as you can!).",
    "Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat. Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min or until softened.",
    "Meanwhile, add the basmati rice and 300ml cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked. Once done, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving. Tip: Add a knob of butter once cooked for extra indulgence.",
    "Meanwhile, peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop the ginger. Peel and roughly chop the garlic.",
    "Add the chopped garlic, ginger, ground coriander, ground cumin, chilli flakes, cayenne pepper and a generous pinch of salt to a pestle & mortar and grind to a smooth paste. Add 2 tbsp vegetable oil and give everything a good mix up - this is your Balchao spice paste. Tip: Alternatively, use a food processor!",
    "Once the onion has softened, add the Balchao spice paste and tomato paste to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until fragrant.",
    "Add the king prawns, tamarind paste, cider vinegar and 1 tsp sugar and cook for 2-3 min or until the prawns are almost cooked through. Add the baby leaf spinach with 60ml cold water and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the spinach has just wilted and the sauce is thickened to a curry-like consistency - this is your Goan prawn Balchao curry.",
    "Serve the Goan prawn Balchao curry over the basmati rice. Enjoy!"
