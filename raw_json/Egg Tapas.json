    "Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7. Cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces. Add them to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil, season with cayenne pepper, salt and pepper, then put in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp - these are your crispy potatoes.",
    "Boil half a kettle. Deseed the red pepper and cut into thin strips. Peel and slice the brown onion finely. Peel and chop (or grate) the garlic finely.",
    "Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the sliced pepper and onion with a pinch of both salt and sugar. Cook for 7-9 min or until they've softened. Once softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 1 min.",
    "Meanwhile, dissolve the Knorr vegetable stock cube in 200ml boiled water, then stir in half of the chipotle paste (save the rest for later). Drain and rinse the cannellini beans. Add the stock and beans to the softened pepper and onion and cook for 10-15 min over a low heat or until reduced to a thick stew.",
    "Trim, then slice the spring onion finely. Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks.",
    "Combine the mayonnaise with the chopped spring onion, remaining chipotle paste, a drizzle of olive oil and half of the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish). Season with a pinch of both salt and pepper and set aside - this is your smoky mayo.",
    "Once your potatoes are almost cooked, proceed with this step! Heat another pan with a matching lid (large enough to fit 2 eggs) with 1 tbsp olive oil over a medium-low heat. Crack the eggs into a bowl, and once the pan is hot, add the eggs in one go. Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking, then remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper.",
    "Stir the remaining chopped coriander through the pepper and bean stew. Serve the eggs over the stew with the crispy potatoes and smoky mayo to the side. Enjoy!"
